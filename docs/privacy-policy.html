    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
    <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

    <h4>Usage Data</h4>
    <p>We collect Usage Data automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device details (e.g., device ID, operating system).</li>
        <li>App interactions (e.g., screen visits, feature usage) via Firebase Analytics (if enabled).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>We use your data to:</p>

        <li>Improve the App through analytics (e.g., usage trends).</li>
        <li>Respond to your inquiries or feedback.</li>
